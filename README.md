## Simulate slow connections

For testing performance, connect the application to [toxiproxy](https://toxiproxy.io) by running

```
./scripts/slow
```

and then connect to http://localhost:8081

The bandwidth and latency of the connection will be affected - see `./scripts/slow --help` for details.

## Proxy & SSL

For now, we're going to use self-signed certificates for `naomi.dide.ic.ac.uk`, which we will replace with more reasonable certificates later.  Certificates are generated during start-up of the proxy container.
