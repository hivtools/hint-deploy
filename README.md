Deployment scripts for [hint](https://github.com/mrc-ide/hint)

## Installation

Clone the repo anywhere and install dependencies with (from the repo root):

```
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

<!-- Regenerate the usage section below by running ./scripts/build_readme -->

<!-- Usage begin -->
```
Usage:
  ./hint start [--pull] [<config>]
  ./hint stop  [--volumes] [--network] [--kill] [--force]
  ./hint destroy
  ./hint status
  ./hint user [--pull] add <email> [<password>]
  ./hint user [--pull] remove <email>
  ./hint user [--pull] exists <email>

Options:
  --pull           Pull images before starting
  --volumes        Remove volumes (WARNING: irreversible data loss)
  --network        Remove network
  --kill           Kill the containers (faster, but possible db corruption)
```
<!-- Usage end -->

Once a configuration is set during `start`, it will be reused by subsequent commands (`stop`, `status`, `upgrade`, `user`, etc) and removed during `destroy`.  The configuration usage information is stored in `config/.last_deploy`.

## Simulate slow connections

For testing performance, connect the application to [toxiproxy](https://toxiproxy.io) by running

```
./scripts/slow
```

and then connect to http://localhost:8081

The bandwidth and latency of the connection will be affected - see `./scripts/slow --help` for details.

## Proxy & SSL

For now, we're going to use self-signed certificates for `naomi.dide.ic.ac.uk`, which we will replace with more reasonable certificates later.  Certificates are generated during start-up of the proxy container.
